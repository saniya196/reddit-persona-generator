# Reddit User Persona Generator

## What this project does
This Python project scrapes Reddit user data (posts and comments) from the web using BeautifulSoup. It then analyzes the data to create a basic persona summary based on the user’s activity.

## How to run the script
1. Make sure Python 3.6+ is installed.  
2. Install the required libraries using:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
Replace `your_script_name.py` with your actual Python script filename.

## Dependencies
- requests  
- beautifulsoup4

## How to analyze a new Reddit user
1. Provide the Reddit username in the script or as input (based on how your code works).  
2. Run the script to fetch and analyze the user’s recent posts and comments.

## Sample data
The repo contains sample `.txt` files with example Reddit user data for testing.

*Note: This is a beginner-level project. The scraping approach can be improved or replaced by official APIs or LLM integration in the future.*
